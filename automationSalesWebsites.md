# A list of automation websites and vendors I use on a regular basis to purchase the parts I need.

## 1. [Automation Direct](https://www.automationdirect.com/)

The grand daddy of them all. Probably one of the most used industrial automation websites. The ease of use, fast turn around times, and easy to navigate websites makes Automation direct a top choice for me. Also lots of resources on how to use their products and PLCs.   Free 2-day shipping on orders over $49!

Some words of caution: If you do get a PLC, stay away from CLICK unless it is just for non-essential components. CLICK PLCs are notorious for not being robust. I had a CLICK fail on me in the field in China in front of customer.

## 2. [FactoryMation](https://www.factorymation.com)

Fast and free shipping on small packages $29 or more and free on freight shipping on $500 or more. A lot "no name" brands at a great price makes FactoryMation a strong competitor on the economy front.

## 3. [Marshall Wolf Automation](https://www.wolfautomation.com/)

Another company with free shipping but on orders over $100. Shipping is by UPS ground shipping. One thing unique to this online seller is they UL 508A value added services. This could make this an all-in-one stop from bill of materials to panel build!

## 4. [Precision Electric](https://www.precision-elec.com)

In the company I work for, we use alot of Lenze VFDs. They are easy to program, cheap, can be bought wash down rated, and can run a sequence which means I can make more skids without PLC controls. Precision Electric tends to have these drives in stock so they have short lead times. Shipping is free on large orders. I would have ranked them higher but recently they have made their website less useful as there is no where to log onto your account anymore.

## 5. [MotionUSA](http://www.motionusa.com)

A lot name brand equipment and PLC's. You do have to create an account to see pricing but they have a lot of motion products you can't get from the previous mentioned websites. Pricing is fairly standard and you probably can get better pricing from your local vendor or at least better support.
