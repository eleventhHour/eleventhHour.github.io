# The Motivation

In October of 2017 my significant other's parents house was destroyed in the Tubbs Fire in Santa Rosa, CA. The night of the fire, they were awaken to very strong winds and when they went outside, a police officer was driving by and told them to get out of dodge! So there were only two ways out, both winding roads. Lucky for them, they escaped with their lives but lost all their belongings. I learned later that this wasn't their first run in with California Wildfires. During the Oakland Hills wildfires, their house was feet away from destruction.

Sadly, not a year later after the Tubbs fire, the Camp Fire destroyed the town of paradise. Several people died in that fire and knowing that the previous year it could have just as easily been my girlfriends parent's I thought: why isn't there an emergency fire shelter? We have emergency shelters for Tornados but not for fires?! From what I can see, California wildfires - although intense - are quick moving and if there was some way people could shelter in place for an hour especially in communities where winding roads make escape near impossible many lives could be saved. I am mechanical engineer by trade and the more I thought about the problem the more it seemed a cost effective solution might be possible.

# Current Solutions

In my very limited research, almost all emergency shelters are geared towards fire fighters as the current assumption has been people will have been evacuated and the only people that could be in such a situation would be fire fighter on the front lines of a fire. Like 9/11, we can no longer take past assumptions for granted. 

The problem we these shelters is they are designed to be light and carried which means all the protection is usually a very thin piece of fire retardent fabric. We if assume people will shelter in place and system has access to all the building resources, at least temporarily, then we can have a much beefier system that could protect both resident and a trapped fire fighter.

# The problems

In my trusty bullet point journal I asked myself (and I apologize if they are a bit morbid) the following questions:

1. What caused the deaths in the intense wildfires we have seen?
2. How long does it take for a single family home to burn down in these fires?
3. How long does it take after the main front of a fire for it to be safe to evacuate/be in the open surroundings?
4. How much temperature increase can people stand?
5. How do you soothe the psychological effects of being trapped in shelter by an ongoing fire?

I figured by answering these questions I might have a chance at actually designing a shelter that would save lives.

## 1. What caused the deaths in the intense wildfires we have seen?

Besides the obvious of fire, we see numerous factors that taken together caused people to die. From a superficial view, the following appears to be true.

1. Buildings located in urban-wildland interfaces, where large trees dominate the landscape helped fire spread faster by allowing fire to jump through the crowns of trees and skid over roads which in low vegetation can act like fire breaks.
2. Landscaping and vegetation immediately around buildings helped bring fire directly to the buildings.
3. Communication about best routes to use was non-existent.
4. Roads to evacuate the area jammed with traffic as everyone was literally trying to escape with their lives.
5. Those who didn't escape, thick smoke blocked visibility to leave.
6. There were no alternatives besides fleeing the area when a fire did trap people.
7. Smoke inhalation and heat eventually is what actually killed people.


A properly designed fire shelter would do nothing for 1 thru 4 but could mitigate items 5 thru 7 for 90% of the situations. 


# Back of the envelope math (currently no math)

As an engineer I want to simplify the problem. I think of the problem in terms of heat and gases. If we can know about how much heat energy a building will give off while burning and how much temperature swing a person can handle, then we can calculate a thermal mass that would give the protection we need. When I think of thermal mass/heat capacity, the first thing that comes to mind is water and every first year chem students favorite equation, Q = MCdT (aka MCAT where the A is a delta symbol)!

So making some simplistic assumptions, such as people don't need to breath (yes, I'm joking), then if we stick a person in a big enough water tank we should be able to keep them from being killed by heat and turning them into a burnt marshmellow. *These Calcs to be continued on another day*

Now, complicating our model, lets assume people do need to breathe! So we need to either give the people sheltering a scuba tank and hope they are relaxed so they don't use up all their air in the time they need to shelter or make a space where they can breathe ambient air, or some combination of the two. A very large tank of water will do great in abosrbing radiant heat, conductive heat but in an ambient air situation maybe not so good at protecting from convective heat. Furthermore, if pursuing an ambient air situation, it is very possible for smoke and other toxic gases to ingress into the shelter. Preventing the ingress of poisonous gases is a must so we must create some positive pressure in our shelter either with filtered air from the burning surroundings or from tanks and we must make sure this air is at a temperature people can breath. I remember hearing a story of people who survived the Sonoma County fires by submerging themselves in their pool. They survived by severley burned their lungs due to the super heated air, so through this morbid experiment we can positively say enough water will protect the body but not the lungs (If we could only breath water damn it!).

Now we could also make a bomb shelter, but this has it's own problems, especially that of cost.
