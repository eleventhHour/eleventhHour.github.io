## [Shankar - Controls Engineer Extraordinaire](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shankar-pakkiru/)
Do you need a machine up and running fast, with minimal fuss and code that is easy to read and maintain? Then look no further than Shankar Pakkiru.

I hired Shankar as a subcontractor for Porifera, and we have never had better looking HMI screens and code that was written so fast. I highly recommend you hire him immediately!!
