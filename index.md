# Welcome to Branden's static web page!
This is a place where I will put links to projects that I have done or I am curently working on as well general interests and thoughts.

## B&R PLCs (aka br-automation or BR PLCs)
I work as a professional PLC programmer of B&R PLCs as well as other manufacturers.

## [Where do you buy automation equipment? ](./automationSalesWebsites.html)

If you have to do your on purchases, you might ask "where do I buy automation equipment." This is a list of online vendors you can use.

## [Shankar - Controls Engineer Extraordinaire](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shankar-pakkiru/)
Do you need a machine up and running fast, with minimal fuss and code that is easy to read and maintain? Then look no further than Shankar Pakkiru.

I hired Shankar as a subcontractor for Porifera, and we have never had better looking HMI screens and code that was written so fast. I highly recommend you hire him immediately!!
